# Directory Analyzer & Organizer 

Just a simple Python script I wrote to practice working with files and the OS module. It helps you clean up messy folders and see where all your hard drive space is going.

##What it does

1. Top 10 Folders: Shows you which folders are taking up the most space.

2. Top 10 Files: Finds the biggest individual files (great for finding old movies or ISOs you forgot about).

3. Organize: Moves files into folders like Images/, Documents/, Audio/ based on their extension.

## How to run it

You need Python installed. That's it.

```python
python file_manager.py
```
Then just paste the path of the folder you want to analyze when asked.

## Note

Be careful with the "Organize" option. It actually moves your files. I use it on my Downloads folder mostly
